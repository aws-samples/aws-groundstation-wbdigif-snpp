# If using collocated AWS GS agent, input protocol for Blink must be UDP.
# We must isolate cores which have been pinned with irq_affinity script to minimize UDP loss, as well from GS agent cores
# for g4dn.metal, they are 0, 1, 24, 25, 48, 49, 72, 73 (kernel), and 2-9, 50-57 (agent)
# for g4dn.12xlarge they are 0, 1, 48, 49
